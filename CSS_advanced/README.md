- The description of the project contains some inspiration for the final look of the project but we’ll have to download some images.
- Head to unsplash and download 10 high resolution images that look as close to the final product that you’re going to make. You will be using these same high res images for a project on Responsive Design in the future. Remember to also include the 3 images (the 2 logos and the favicon) linked in the description of the project.
- The images should all be representative of category they belong to. Images in the work category should be closely related to work.

styles/1-style.css - When scrolling is triggered on the html element itself, we’d like the behavior of the scroll to be as fluid as possible.

styles/3-style.css - Based on styles/2-style.css:
    • Target the root element and define the following custom properties:
        -color-primary set to #d73953
        -color-black set to #090909
        -color-white set to #ffffff
        -color-light-grey set to #f3f3f3
        -color-dark-grey set to #353535
        -text-color set to color-black
    • Revisit the section-tagline and card-category declarations and reset their color to color-primary
    • Revisit the body and anchor declarations and reset their color to text-color
